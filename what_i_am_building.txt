Tech Stack Outline (for Developer Build)

Layer	Tool/Stack
Frontend	React + TailwindCSS
Backend	Node.js or Python Flask
Auth	JWT + Biometric (Mobile)
DB	PostgreSQL
File Upload	AWS S3
Notifications	OneSignal
CMS	Custom or Strapi (Headless)
Hosting	AWS EC2 or Vercel


⸻


Here’s the blueprint your devs need.

⸻

1. Core Goals
	•	Single Membership Auto app for iOS + Android.
	•	Authenticated access to Future Tech backend (membership, vehicles, service history, appointments, billing).
	•	Live link to vehicle via OBD-II dongle/Reed device where possible; fallback for older vehicles.
	•	Fuel-economy tracking with both automatic (OBD) and AI/assist manual modes.
	•	Communication, referrals, push reminders, and location features as shown in your UI.

⸻

2. Recommended Tech Stack (guidance, not mandatory)

Front end (mobile):
	•	React Native (TypeScript) or Flutter.
	•	Navigation: React Navigation (if RN) with stack + tab navigator.
	•	State: Redux Toolkit / Zustand / Bloc (dev choice).
	•	Secure storage: iOS Keychain / Android Keystore wrapper.

Backend interface (Future Tech):
	•	Token-based auth (JWT or Cognito-style).
	•	REST or GraphQL; REST is assumed below.
	•	Hosted on AWS (ALB / API Gateway + Lambdas or container services).

3rd-party services:
	•	Maps: Apple Maps + Google Maps via cross-platform maps SDK.
	•	Push: Amazon SNS/Pinpoint or OneSignal (if you already use it).
	•	Chat: custom WebSocket service OR hosted (Sendbird/Stream/Twilio Conversations).
	•	Image/receipt OCR for pumps: your own AI endpoint or AWS Rekognition/Textract behind Future Tech.

⸻

3. High-Level Architecture
	1.	App
	•	Handles UI, local state, offline cache, Bluetooth connection to dongle.
	•	Talks only to Future Tech API (and to the OBD dongle via BLE/Wi-Fi).
	2.	Future Tech API
	•	Auth / user management
	•	Membership & vehicle data
	•	Appointments & service recommendations
	•	Referral tracking and rewards
	•	Push notification orchestration
	•	Chat back-end and message store
	•	Fuel economy & telematics ingestion and analytics
	•	Social link configuration (so you can change URLs without app update)
	3.	Reed/OBD Device Integration Layer
	•	App-side: BLE/Wi-Fi driver; requests standard PIDs (speed, fuel rate, fuel level, odometer if supported, DTCs).
	•	Server-side (optional): if dongle already talks to your cloud, app just consumes it via Future Tech.

⸻

4. User Roles & Authentication

Roles:
	•	Customer (driver) — standard user.
	•	Internal staff (optional future) — separate staff app or admin web.

Flows:
	1.	Sign Up
	•	Inputs: email, phone, password, name, membership ID/verification code.
	•	API: POST /auth/register.
	•	Email/SMS verification optional but recommended.
	2.	Login
	•	POST /auth/login → returns { accessToken, refreshToken, userProfile }.
	•	Tokens stored in secure storage; refresh handled transparently.
	3.	Forgot Password
	•	POST /auth/forgot-password (send code) + POST /auth/reset-password.
	4.	Session Management
	•	Refresh token flow.
	•	Forced logout on invalid/expired tokens.

⸻

	•	Test connection: request sample PID (RPM or speed).
	2.	Real-Time Vehicle Data
	•	App polls the dongle over BLE at a fixed interval while driving OR reads last values from Future Tech if dongle streams to cloud.
	•	Data points (minimum): speed, fuel rate or fuel used, odometer if supported, DTCs, coolant temp, fuel level.
	•	App pushes telemetry batch to POST /telematics/{vehicleId} when trip ends or periodically.
	3.	Vehicle List & Switcher
	•	Support multiple vehicles per account (you’ve mentioned this elsewhere).
	•	Allow user to select “active vehicle” for tracking, appointments, and offers.

⸻

5.3 Fuel Economy Tracking

Mode A – Automatic (preferred, newer vehicles)
	•	Use OBD PIDs:
	•	Fuel used vs distance → instant and average MPG/L/100km.
	•	App logic:
	•	Each ignition cycle = “trip”; compute trip MPG and send to /vehicles/{id}/fuel-logs.
	•	Show:
	•	Avg MPG (last 30 days).
	•	MPG per trip / tank.
	•	Trend graph.

Mode B – Assisted Manual (older vehicles)
	•	“Add Fill-Up” button:
	•	Step 1: Take photo of pump display / receipt.
	•	Step 2: Optional photo of odometer.
	•	Step 3: Manual confirmation/edit of fields AI extracts:
	•	Gallons/liters filled, total cost, price per unit.
	•	Current odometer (if readable; else user types it).
	•	App sends image(s) → Future Tech AI endpoint:
	•	POST /fuel-ocr returns structured values.
	•	Mileage calc:
	•	distance = current_odometer - last_odometer
	•	mpg = distance / gallons.
	•	Store in fuel_logs table and show same graphs/report as automatic mode.

⸻

5.4 Special Offers

	•	Store tokens only in encrypted secure storage.
	•	Minimal PII on device; wipe on logout.
	•	Obfuscate app for Android; use App Transport Security on iOS.
	•	Rate-limit and authenticate telematics endpoints.

⸻

9. Deliverables for the Dev Team
	1.	Mobile app repo (React Native or Flutter) with:
	•	Auth flow wired to Future Tech test API.
	•	Modular services layer (AuthService, VehicleService, AppointmentService, etc.).
	•	Feature modules as listed above.
	2.	API spec (OpenAPI/Swagger) for all listed endpoints so mobile and Future Tech stay in sync.
	3.	Integration doc for Reed/OBD hardware:
	•	BLE characteristics, expected PIDs, pairing flow, sample payloads.
	4.	Push notification mapping doc:
	•	Event → notification template → deep link target screen.

If you hand them this outline and insist on token-based API contracts plus proper Reed device docs, they’ll have everything they need to build a real app, not a gimmick.
